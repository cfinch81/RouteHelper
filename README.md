# Route Helper plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki)

This plugin helps commanders follow pre-determined routes such as those generated by [Spansh](http://spansh.co.uk) Neutron Router and Road to Riches.

The plugin takes a list of systems, and when you jump into a system in the list the plugin will copy the next system in the list to clipboard.  Just visit the galaxy map and paste your next destination in!  No need to task out of the game to copy the next destination to the clipboard.

## Installation

* On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the “Open” button. This reveals the `plugins` folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/cfinch81/RouteHelper/releases/latest).
* Open the `.zip` archive that you downloaded and move the `RouteHelper` folder contained inside into the `plugins` folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin.

## Usage

* On EDMC's Route Helper settings tab press the “Select Route File” button.
* Select a csv or text file.
    * csv files must contain the system name as the first column.  [Spansh](http://spansh.co.uk) Neutron Router and Road to Riches csv files are compatible.
    * text files must contain one system per line.
* Upon jumping into a system, the next system in the list will be copied to the clipboard ready to paste into the galaxy map.
